# Homelab Project Deploy Checklist

Walk through every item before declaring a deploy of this project
complete. If an item does not apply, mark `N/A` with one line of
justification (so the next reader knows it was considered, not
forgotten).

## Build and image

- [ ] Artifact provenance is immutable. A first-party image is built and pushed
  to the private registry with a version tag and recorded digest; an upstream
  image is pinned to the reviewed platform digest. `docker save | ssh docker
  load` is a documented fallback only.
- [ ] The target host can resolve and fetch the exact declared image digest.
- [ ] Image naming and transfer follow the current
  `~/src/home-infra/docs/CONVENTIONS.md` *Docker Image Management* rules.

## Secrets

- [ ] Doppler project + config exist in the operator-approved workspace.
- [ ] On dev-vm: Doppler CLI authenticated (`doppler login`).
- [ ] On NAS: service token configured (Doppler CLI not installed on
  NAS; use `dopplerhq/cli` Docker image with `DOPPLER_TOKEN`).
- [ ] No secret values committed to this repo, to `infra.contract.yml`,
  or to any docs.

## Runtime

- [ ] `docker-compose.yml` placed at the standard path:
  - dev-vm: `~/runtime/<project>/docker-compose.yml`
  - NAS: `/share/Container/compose/<project>/docker-compose.yml`
- [ ] Container starts cleanly (`docker compose up -d`).
- [ ] Healthcheck passes (if defined). Logs show no errors on startup.
- [ ] On NAS, verified the docker-compose path workaround:
  `/usr/local/lib/docker/cli-plugins/docker-compose up -d`.

## Home Infra source publication gate (`~/src/home-infra/`)

- [ ] `docs/INVENTORY.md` updated when hosts, ports, or IPs change.
- [ ] `docs/SERVICES.md` updated with the new or relocated service.
- [ ] Canonical `docs/PROJECTS.yml` updated and validated; generated
  `docs/PROJECTS.md` refreshed only through
  `python3 scripts/project-registry.py render --write`.
- [ ] Project Birth acceptance recorded in
  `catalog/project-acceptances.yml` when applicable.
- [ ] `catalog/services.yml` updated **only if portal-visible**
  (will be rendered by `infra-portal`).
- [ ] `catalog/project-contracts.yml` and the Portal contract bundler updated
  when the project contract is portal-visible.
- [ ] The vhost is declared in Home Infra's source-controlled edge-caddy
  configuration with the narrowest backend route.
- [ ] Catalog, project registry, generated projection, contract joins and edge
  candidate all validate.
- [ ] All Home Infra source inputs committed and pushed before DNS, edge apply,
  runtime catalog synchronization, or Portal readback.

## Network and TLS (only if the project exposes UI / API / status)

- [ ] DNS configured through Home Infra's current bounded UniFi procedure:
  `<service>.lamanoriega.com → <host-ip>` (TTL 300).
- [ ] The Home Infra edge helper passed check and apply from the clean published
  Home Infra revision:
  ```sh
  scripts/edge-caddy-config --check
  scripts/edge-caddy-config --apply
  ```
  The helper owns candidate validation, backup, bounded recreation, adjacent
  ingress checks and automatic rollback; do not patch the NAS Caddyfile or
  restart the shared proxy manually.
- [ ] HTTPS verified from LAN
  (`curl -fsS https://<service>.lamanoriega.com/...`).
- [ ] Cert chain confirmed
  (`*.lamanoriega.com` wildcard, currently valid).

## Infra Portal (only if portal-visible)

- [ ] Ran Home Infra's canonical `scripts/sync-portal-inputs-to-nas.sh` only
  after the Home Infra and project contract revisions were clean and pushed.
- [ ] Verified catalog, contracts and provenance readback without restarting
  Infra Portal.

## Documentation in this project

- [ ] `docs/operations/DEPLOY_PLAYBOOK.md` reflects the deploy reality
  (paths, images, hosts, compose location, rollback recipe). Links to
  `~/src/home-infra/docs/CONVENTIONS.md` instead of duplicating it.
- [ ] `docs/llm/HANDOFF.md` *Last Updated* and *Session Focus* match
  this session.
- [ ] `docs/llm/HISTORY.md` has an entry for this deploy.
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` reflects the new version.
- [ ] `VERSION` and all version-synced doc-version markers in sync
  (`scripts/check-version-sync.sh`).
- [ ] Project repo committed and pushed.

## Project interface

- [ ] `infra.contract.yml` declared at the project root, with `TODO`
      placeholders replaced by real values.
- [ ] Every project-owned loop classified correctly:
      `sync_jobs[]` for an external source of truth,
      `telemetry_jobs[]` for self/host observation.
- [ ] Every declared job has a sanitized representative status snapshot.
- [ ] Operator-visible capabilities are declared in `capabilities[]`; every
      restricted capability has a stable reason and explicit enablement path.
- [ ] Capabilities that require runtime proof reference a telemetry job, and
      its representative snapshot publishes the complete observation set.
- [ ] Canonical validation passes without a copied validator:
      `~/src/home-infra-protocol/scripts/validate-project-interface.py
      --contract infra.contract.yml
      --status <job-id>=<representative-status.json>`.
- [ ] Periodic jobs declare `stale_after > cadence`; producer snapshots do not
      self-declare freshness.
- [ ] No secret values in the contract; only approved store and variable
      references.
- [ ] Note in `docs/llm/DECISIONS.md` recording that this project
      declares a contract and which protocol version it targets.
- [ ] Contract and status provenance presented to the operator; Home Infra was
      not edited or treated as accepting the interface automatically.
- [ ] Private incubating fields such as `operational_review` were not copied
      into the reusable project contract.
- [ ] Capability observations contain availability evidence only and do not
      repeat policy, scope, risk, secret, identity, command, or message data.

## Final smoke check

- [ ] From a LAN client: the service responds at its public URL with
  the expected status, payload, or login screen.
- [ ] From a WireGuard client: same as above.
- [ ] No regression in adjacent services on the same host
  (spot-check at least one other vhost on `edge-caddy`).
