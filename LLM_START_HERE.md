# LLM Start Guide - Home Infra Protocol

## Read This First

Home Infra Protocol is a specification project. It defines contracts, schemas,
examples, and future validator behavior for Git-based infrastructure memory.

Recommended reading order:

1. This file.
2. `SPEC.md`.
3. `docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`.
4. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
5. `docs/COMPLETION_RULE.md`.
6. `docs/llm/HANDOFF.md`.
7. `docs/llm/DECISIONS.md`.

## Critical Rules

### Language Policy

- Conversation with Carlos: Spanish.
- Code, docs, comments, file names, schemas, and examples: English.
- Examples must be sanitized: no real private LAN IPs, hostnames, domains, or
  secrets from Carlos's home infrastructure.

<!-- DOCKIT-TEMPLATE:START doc-update-rules -->
### Documentation Update Rules
- Update docs/llm/HANDOFF.md every time you make a change.
- Append an entry to docs/llm/HISTORY.md in every session.
- HISTORY format: YYYY-MM-DD - <LLM_NAME> - <Brief summary> - Files: [list] - Version impact: [yes/no + details]
- Put long-form rationale in docs/llm/DECISIONS.md and link to it from HANDOFF.
- Prefer ASCII-only in docs/llm/* to avoid Windows encoding issues.
<!-- DOCKIT-TEMPLATE:END doc-update-rules -->

<!-- DOCKIT-TEMPLATE:START doc-sync-rules -->
### Documentation Sync Rules
- Keep this file's "Current Focus" section synchronized with docs/llm/HANDOFF.md "Current Status".
- Keep docs/STRUCTURE.md synchronized with the actual repository file tree.
- Keep docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md synchronized with architectural reality.
- Version markers (`<!-- doc-version: X.Y.Z -->`) in documentation files are managed by `scripts/bump-version.sh`. See `docs/version-sync-manifest.yml` for the full list of tracked files.
<!-- DOCKIT-TEMPLATE:END doc-sync-rules -->

<!-- DOCKIT-TEMPLATE:START commit-policy -->
### Commit Message Policy
- Every response that includes code or documentation changes must end with suggested commit information:
  - **Title:** under 72 characters
  - **Description:** under 200 characters, focused on user impact and why the change matters
- Format:
  `
  ## Commit Info
  **Title:** <concise title>
  **Description:** <short explanation of what changed and why>
  `
<!-- DOCKIT-TEMPLATE:END commit-policy -->

<!-- DOCKIT-TEMPLATE:START version-management -->
### Version Management
- Every commit that changes code/config files MUST include a version bump. The pre-commit hook enforces this.
- For version bumps, run `scripts/bump-version.sh <new_version>`; do not edit version strings manually.
- The bump script reads `docs/version-sync-manifest.yml` to update all tracked files atomically.
- Validate sync with `scripts/check-version-sync.sh` (also available as pre-commit hook).
- Do not bump versions without consulting docs/VERSIONING_RULES.md for impact level (patch/minor/major).
- Do NOT batch multiple code commits without versioning. No exceptions.
<!-- DOCKIT-TEMPLATE:END version-management -->

## Project-Specific Rules

- This repository is a protocol/specification project first, not a runtime.
- Keep real deployments in private implementation repos such as `home-infra`.
- Consumers such as portals, MCP servers, and agents must not become authorities
  unless the protocol explicitly assigns that role.
- Telemetry is not intent. Observed status can warn about drift, but it does not
  rewrite the source-of-truth catalog.
- Schema evolution should be additive until a major version.

## Current Focus

Source of truth: `docs/llm/HANDOFF.md`.

- Last Updated: 2026-05-25 - Codex.
- Working on: protocol 0.5.1 filing for DF-009 development-preview anti-rot.
- Status: `Service.environment` is formal protocol in 0.5.0; 0.5.1 records the
  next follow-up for owner/freshness/expiry metadata and stale-preview checks.

## LLM-to-LLM Communication
When handing off to another LLM:
1. Update docs/llm/HANDOFF.md with the current state and next steps.
2. Append an entry to docs/llm/HISTORY.md following the required format.
3. Ensure the snapshot in this file matches the latest status.

<!-- DOCKIT-TEMPLATE:START trace-protocol -->
## Trace Protocol

For execution or audit work, begin each substantive execution report or audit
verdict with a compact `Trace` header, then write the normal explanation in
prose. The header is for orientation; it does not replace the message.

Required chat header fields:
- `Role`: `executor` or `auditor`
- `Sent`: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS <local-tz> (HH:MM:SS UTC)`. The order and
  precision are mandatory: local time first, UTC second in parentheses, seconds
  included on both sides.
- `Subject`: current task, or commit hash/title being implemented or audited
- `Resulting state`: what this message leaves true after it is sent
- `Repo state`: local branch vs origin and worktree status verified now
- `Validation`: checks run and result
- `Next gate`: who/what should act next

Time verification:
- Verify `Sent` before writing it; do not infer or mentally convert the time.
- If shell access is available, run both:
  ```sh
  date -u '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S UTC'
  TZ=Europe/Madrid date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z'
  ```
- Replace `Europe/Madrid` with `trace_protocol.local_timezone` from
  `.dockit-config.yml` when the project sets one.
- If the agent cannot verify the clock, write:
  `Sent: unverified client time YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS <claimed-tz>`.

Recommended `Resulting state` shape:

```text
Resulting state: HEAD=<hash|unchanged (hash)>; version=<version|none>; gate=<opened|cleared|blocked|superseded|next-slice>; <short note>
```

Examples:

```text
Resulting state: HEAD=01f90bb; version=4.9.1; gate=cleared; supersedes audit of d6fc816
Resulting state: HEAD=unchanged (01f90bb); version=none; gate=cleared; ready for next slice
Resulting state: HEAD=unchanged (d6fc816); version=none; gate=blocked; requires executor patch v4.9.1
```

Use clear prose after the header. Explain what changed, why it matters, what
was verified, and what risk remains.

When reading an older Trace block, do not treat its `Repo state` as current
without checking the tree again. If the `Sent` time is more than a few minutes
old, or another LLM/operator may have acted since it was written, verify
`git status`, `git log -1`, and the current clock before acting on the report.

When `trace_protocol.enabled: true` is set in `.dockit-config.yml`, the durable
half is enforced by `scripts/dockit-validate-session.sh --check trace-protocol`:
- `docs/llm/HANDOFF.md` must contain a `## Trace Anchor` section.
- HANDOFF Trace Anchor commit times may use `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC` or
  `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC`.
- `docs/llm/HISTORY.md` entries dated on or after `trace_protocol.since` that
  reference backtick-quoted commit hashes must end with an inline footer:
  `Trace: role=executor|auditor; commits=hash1,hash2; state=...; validation=...; next=...`

Projects can set the local timezone used in `Sent` with:

```yaml
trace_protocol:
  local_timezone: Europe/Madrid
```

Projects that do not use executor/auditor windows can disable the chat-side
convention with:

```yaml
trace_protocol:
  enabled: false
```

Every change must be documented. If you are unsure about a rule, ask the user before proceeding.
