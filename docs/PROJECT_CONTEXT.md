# Project Context - Home Infra Protocol

## Vision

Home Infra Protocol is a reusable specification for Git-based infrastructure
memory. It lets humans, dashboards, MCP servers, recovery workflows, and LLM
agents agree on what infrastructure exists, where truth lives, and when a
change is complete.

The protocol is motivated by a private implementation: `home-infra` as the
source-of-truth repository and `infra-portal` as a read-only consumer. This repo
extracts the reusable pattern without publishing private operational details.

## Objectives

- Define a minimal vocabulary for hosts, services, projects, dependencies,
  runbooks, probes, and consumers.
- Publish schemas for machine-readable catalogs and project contracts.
- Document the completion rule for human and LLM-assisted infrastructure
  changes.
- Provide sanitized examples that private repos can copy.
- Defer runtime tooling until the specification has stabilized.

## Stakeholders

- Product owner: Carlos de la Lama-Noriega
- Technical owner: Carlos de la Lama-Noriega
- Primary users: Carlos and LLM agents operating his infrastructure
- Future users: homelab and small-infra operators who want LLM-readable
  infrastructure memory

## Architectural Overview

The protocol separates source-of-truth repositories from consumers.

```text
source-of-truth repo
  human docs + machine catalogs
        |
        +--> visual portal
        +--> MCP server
        +--> validators
        +--> recovery workflows
```

Consumers may observe, render, validate, and warn. They must not silently become
authorities over inventory or intent.

## Key Components

| Component | Purpose | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| `SPEC.md` | Main protocol definition | Draft v0.1 |
| `schemas/` | JSON Schema drafts | Services, hosts, project contracts |
| `examples/` | Sanitized example repos/contracts | No real LAN details |
| `docs/COMPLETION_RULE.md` | Definition of done for infrastructure changes | Core LLM discipline |
| `docs/PROJECT_CONTRACTS.md` | Project-level contract direction | Future ingestion from project repos |

## Current Status (2026-07-13)

Protocol 0.9.0 adds optional human labels to status snapshot checks from real
ForumVault producer and Infra Portal consumer evidence. Stable `name` remains
machine identity; `label` and `summary` are display-only.

## Upcoming Milestones

1. Let Plaud Mirror and MessageVault adopt optional check labels when their
   producer surfaces next change; no forced migration is required.
2. Keep Home Infra expectations, waivers, provider choice, portal assessments,
   and action-plane policy outside the public protocol.
3. Keep later status vocabulary adopter-driven rather than adding speculative
   presentation fields.
